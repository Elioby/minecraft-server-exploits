# minecraft-server-exploits
A compiled list of current Minecraft server and Minecraft server plugin exploits. Feel free to open issues / pull requests with new exploits.

## General Rules
In order to prevent exploits before they're discovered, there's a few things you can do:
 - Always use the latest available [Paper](https://papermc.io/downloads) version (not spigot)
 - Install the [IllegalStack](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dupe-fixes-illegal-stack-remover.44411/) plugin

## Vanilla Exploits

### Entity Collision Exploit ([link](https://youtu.be/Ks7mmrer37g?t=225))
A common way for players to drop TPS quickly is by putting entities inside eachother, such as Minecarts or Armor Stands.

#### Patch
To patch this for Minecarts, you can install the [CAProtect-Lite](https://github.com/castaway-gg/CAProtect-Lite) plugin, this will only patch specifically for minecarts though.

To patch for armor stands, you can go into your `paper.yml` file and change the `armor-stands-do-collision-entity-lookups` option to `false`, or `armor-stands-tick` to `false`. Note however that this will obviouisly break some vanilla mechanics.  

## Plugin Exploits

### Multiverse Crash Exploit ([link](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues/2703))
You can very easily crash a server with an older version of Multiverse using a specific /mv command. 

#### Patch
This is patched in newer versions of Multiverse. 

If you rely on an older version of Multiverse for legacy Minecraft support, you can negate the `multiverse.*` permission, or install the [Multiverse-Patches](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/multiverse-patches.96390/) plugin.
